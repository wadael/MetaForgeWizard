# MetaForgeWizard
This software is a Forge2 addon that will help you generate wizard-style addons.+ 
Because, however simple it is to create a wizard, I hate to have typos and the more steps the more risk of typos.

So, here comes this addon that will generate all the classes, linked between them, linearly.

## Usage
* create an addon project
* Give the command a name, a comma-separated list of steps names for the the resulting wizard 


+
wizard-generator --commandName do-that-business-thing --stepsNames MyStartWizard,MyStep1,MyStep2,MyStep3,MyStep4,MyStep5,MyStep6,MyStep7 --destinationSourceFolder gen

* validate 
* and hack it


This command will generate 8 classes responding to the Forge command _do-that-business-thing_, put in the folder _gen_ of the current (addon) project.


## Next ?
Well, you refactor the package because org.wadael.changeme is probably not what you want in your source tree. Then have a look at the **TODO**s in the code. 
And of course, implement your business thing
